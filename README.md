# standalone-scripts
These are scripts developed for school, personal projects, or simply on a whim.

PortScanner.py
This script takes an ip address/range, port targets, and scan methods as arguments.  The scan methods include TCP, UDP, and ICMP.  After receiving the arguments and verifying their validity, it then runs scans with scapy on the specified targets.  Output is stored as a pdf in the same local folder.
